						<p>We designed and implemented BigStation, a 
							scalable architecture that enables realtime signal processing in large-scale MIMO 
							systems which may have tens or hundreds of antennas. Our strategy to scale is to 
							extensively parallelize the MU-MIMO processing on many simple and low-cost commodity 
							computing devices. Our design can incrementally support more antennas by proportionally 
							adding more computing devices. To reduce the overall processing latency, which is a 
							critical constraint for wireless communication, we parallelize the MU-MIMO processing 
							with a distributed pipeline based on its computation and communication patterns. At 
							each stage of the pipeline, we further use data partitioning and computation partitioning 
							to increase the processing speed. As a proof of concept, we have built a BigStation 
							prototype based on commodity PC servers and standard Ethernet switches. Our prototype 
							employs 15 PC servers and can support real-time processing of 12 software radio antennas. 
							Our results show that the BigStation architecture is able to scale to tens to hundreds 
							of antennas. With 12 antennas, our BigStation prototype can increase wireless capacity 
							by 6.8x with a low mean processing delay of 860Î¼s. While this latency is not yet low 
							enough for the 802.11 MAC, it already satisfies the real-time requirements of many 
							existing wireless standards, e.g., LTE and WCDMA.</p>

						<h4>Blockchain-Empowered Transactive Energy <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9208788" target="_blank"> [ <i class="fas fa-link"></i> IEEE TII ]</a></h4>
						<p>Transactive energy plays a key role in the operation and energy management of future power systems. 
							However, the conventional operational mechanism, which follows a centralized design, is often less 
							secure, vulnerable to malicious behaviors, and suffers from privacy leakage. In this work, we 
							introduce blockchain technology in transactive energy to address these challenges. Specifically, 
							we develop a novel blockchain-based transactive energy framework for prosumers and design a 
							decentralized energy trading algorithm that matches the operation of the underlying blockchain 
							system. We prove that the trading algorithm improves the individual benefit and guarantees the 
							socially optimal performance, and thus incentivizes prosumers to join the transactive energy 
							platform. Moreover, we evaluate the feasibility of the transactive energy platform throughout 
							the implementation of a small-scale network of Internet of Things (IoT) devices and extensive 
							simulations using real-world data. Our results show that this blockchain-based transactive 
							energy platform is feasible in practice, and the decentralized trading algorithm reduces the 
							user's individual cost by up to 77\% and lowers the overall cost by 24\%.</p>

						<h4>Secure Blockchain Applications <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.15161" target="_blank"> [ <i class="fas fa-link"></i> IEEE IoT Magazine ]</a></h4>
						<p>As a disruptive technology that originates from cryptocurrency, blockchain provides a trusted platform to facilitate industrial IoT (IIoT) 
							applications. However, implementing a blockchain platform in IIoT scenarios confronts various security challenges due to the rigorous 
							deployment condition. To this end, we present a novel design of secure blockchain based on trusted computing hardware for IIoT applications. 
							Specifically, we employ the trusted execution environment (TEE) module and a customized security chip to safeguard the blockchain against 
							different attacking vectors. Furthermore, we implement the proposed secure IIoT blockchain on the ARM-based embedded device and build a 
							small-scale IIoT network to evaluate its performance. Our experimental results show that the secure blockchain platform achieves a high 
							throughput (150TPS) with low transaction confirmation delay (below 66ms), demonstrating its feasibility in practical IIoT scenarios. 
							Finally, we outline the open challenges and future research directions.</p>

						<h4>Physical-Layer Network Coding <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6940322" target="_blank"> [ <i class="fas fa-link"></i> IEEE TWC ]</a></h4>
						<p>This paper investigates the decoding process of asynchronous convolutional-coded physical-layer network coding (PNC) systems. Specifically, we put forth 
							a layered decoding framework for convolutional-coded PNC consisting of three layers: symbol realignment layer, codeword realignment layer, and joint 
							channel-decoding network coding (Jt-CNC) decoding layer. Our framework can deal with phase asynchrony (phase offset) and symbol arrival-time asynchrony 
							(symbol misalignment) between the signals simultaneously transmitted by multiple sources. A salient feature of this framework is that it can handle 
							both fractional and integral symbol misalignments. For the decoding layer, instead of Jt-CNC, previously proposed PNC decoding algorithms (e.g., 
							XOR-CD and reduced-state Viterbi algorithms) can also be used with our framework to deal with general symbol misalignments. Our Jt-CNC algorithm, 
							based on belief propagation, is BER-optimal for synchronous PNC and near optimal for asynchronous PNC. Extending beyond convolutional codes, we 
							further generalize the Jt-CNC decoding algorithm for all cyclic codes. Our simulation shows that Jt-CNC outperforms the previously proposed XOR-CD 
							algorithm and reduced-state Viterbi algorithm by 2 dB for synchronous PNC. For both phase-asynchronous and symbol-asynchronous PNC, Jt-CNC performs 
							better than the other two algorithms. Importantly, for real wireless network experimentation, we implemented our decoding algorithm in a PNC 
							prototype built on the USRP software radio platform. Our experiment shows that the proposed Jt-CNC decoder works well in practice.</p>
